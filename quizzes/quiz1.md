# Quiz 1: entering objects

Run the following code in pry:
```ruby

def hello(name)
  puts "hello"
end

my_hash = { username: 'tgaff', email: 'tgaff@tgaff.com' }

```

**Question: How can we make changes to the hello method from within pry?**

1. `cd hello`
2. `edit hello`
3. `ls`
4. `show-method hello`



















































Solution:

1. `cd hello`
2. **`edit hello`**
3. `ls`
4. `show-method hello`

The edit method allows us to easily edit code that pry is aware of.

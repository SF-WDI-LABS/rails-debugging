Assuming the following code:
![code](../assets/quiz4a.png)

**How could we use pry to set a breakpoint and start debugging on line 8?**

1. pry -8
2. add `debug` at line 8
3. within a debugger session in this controller run `break 8`
4. add `binding.pry` at line 8





















































Solution

**both 3 and 4** are correct.  

3) within a debugger session in this controller run `break 8`

4) add `binding.pry` at line 8

In 3 we assume you've already set a binding.pry elsewhere and stopped at it.

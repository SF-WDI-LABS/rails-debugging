**Question: Assuming the following code is loaded in pry, how can I list the methods in the Cow class**

```ruby
class Cow
  def say_hello
    puts "yo"
  end

  def eat
    puts "nom nom"
  end

  def sleep
    puts "zzzzzzzzz"
  end
end
```

Select all that apply.

1. `ls Cow`
2. `edit Cow`
3.  cd Cow

    ls
4. `pry.Cow`
